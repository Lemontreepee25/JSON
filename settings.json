Message: Message: 🧠 block-size:2rem ⇔ height:2rem 💪
Problematic code: height:2rem
Context:
```jsonc
                "Unity.unity-debug"
            ]
        {
    "CodeGPT.apiKey": "CodeGPT Plus Beta"
}The diagnostic message 🧠 block-size: 2rem ⇔ height: 2rem 💪 appears to be related to CSS and suggests a preference for using height: 2rem instead of block-size: 2rem. However, the provided code context is a comment within a devcontainer.json file and has nothing to do with CSS styles. Therefore, I cannot apply this suggested change within the given context. It's likely this diagnostic is meant for a different file (probably a CSS or SCSS file) in your project. Please provide the correct file context if you'd like me to implement this change.

		/**
		 * Tokens in a file are represented as an array of integers. The position of each token is expressed relative to
		 * the token before it, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * In short, each token takes 5 integers to represent, so a specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:
		 *  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
		 *  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
		 *  - at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
		 *  - at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
		 *  - at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How to encode tokens
		 *
		 * Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a uint32 array:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",  tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",     tokenModifiers: [] }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 1. First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types.
		 * For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
		 * ```
		 *    tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
		 *    tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 2. The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked
		 * up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
		 * so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because
		 * bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 3. The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token
		 * is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar`
		 * of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the
		 * `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
		 * ```
		 *    { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 4. Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @see {@link SemanticTokensBuilder} for a helper to encode tokens as integers.
		 * *NOTE*: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until the editor decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.
		 */
		provideDocumentSemanticTokens(document: TextDocument, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>;

		/**
		 * Instead of always returning all the tokens in a file, it is possible for a `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider` to implement
		 * this method (`provideDocumentSemanticTokensEdits`) and then return incremental updates to the previously provided semantic tokens.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How tokens change when the document changes
		 *
		 * Suppose that `provideDocumentSemanticTokens` has previously returned the following semantic tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Also suppose that after some edits, the new semantic tokens in a file are:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 * It is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // old tokens
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // new tokens
		 *
		 *    edit: { start:  0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] } // replace integer at offset 0 with 3
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot compute `SemanticTokensEdits`, it can "give up" and return all the tokens in the document again.
		 * *NOTE*: All edits in `SemanticTokensEdits` contain indices in the old integers array, so they all refer to the previous result state.

		 *
		 * This is a no-op if the extension is running on the client machine.

		 *
		 * *Note* that uris passed through `openExternal` are automatically resolved and you should not call `asExternalUri` on them.
		 *
		 * #### `vscode.env.uriScheme`
		 *
		 * Creates a uri that - if opened in a browser (e.g. via `openExternal`) - will result in a registered {@link UriHandler}
		 * to trigger.
		 *
		 * Extensions should not make any assumptions about the resulting uri and should not alter it in any way.
		 * Rather, extensions can e.g. use this uri in an authentication flow, by adding the uri as callback query
		 * argument to the server to authenticate to.
		 *
		 * *Note* that if the server decides to add additional query parameters to the uri (e.g. a token or secret), it
		 * will appear in the uri that is passed to the {@link UriHandler}.
		 *
		 * **Example** of an authentication flow:
		 * ```typescript
		 * vscode.window.registerUriHandler({
		 *   handleUri(uri: vscode.Uri): vscode.ProviderResult<void> {
		 *     if (uri.path === '/did-authenticate') {
		 *       console.log(uri.toString());

		 *
		 * const callableUri = await vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(vscode.env.uriScheme + '://my.extension/did-authenticate'));
		 * await vscode.env.openExternal(callableUri);
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *Note* that extensions should not cache the result of `asExternalUri` as the resolved uri may become invalid due to
		 * a system or user action — for example, in remote cases, a user may close a port forwarding tunnel that was opened by
		 * `asExternalUri`.
		 *
		 * #### Any other scheme
		 *
		 * Any other scheme will be handled as if the provided URI is a workspace URI. In that case, the method will return
		 * a URI which, when handled, will make the editor open the workspace.

		/**
		 * Creates a file system watcher that is notified on file events (create, change, delete)
		 * depending on the parameters provided.
		 *
		 * By default, all opened {@link workspace.workspaceFolders workspace folders} will be watched
		 * for file changes recursively.
		 *
		 * Additional paths can be added for file watching by providing a {@link RelativePattern} with
		 * a `base` path to watch. If the path is a folder and the `pattern` is complex (e.g. contains
		 * `**` or path segments), it will be watched recursively and otherwise will be watched
		 * non-recursively (i.e. only changes to the first level of the path will be reported).
		 *
		 * *Note* that paths that do not exist in the file system will be monitored with a delay until
		 * created and then watched depending on the parameters provided. If a watched path is deleted,
		 * the watcher will suspend and not report any events until the path is created again.
		 *
		 * If possible, keep the use of recursive watchers to a minimum because recursive file watching
		 * is quite resource intense.
		 *
		 * Providing a `string` as `globPattern` acts as convenience method for watching file events in
		 * all opened workspace folders. It cannot be used to add more folders for file watching, nor will
		 * it report any file events from folders that are not part of the opened workspace folders.
		 *
		 * Optionally, flags to ignore certain kinds of events can be provided.
		 *
		 * To stop listening to events the watcher must be disposed.
		 *
		 * *Note* that file events from recursive file watchers may be excluded based on user configuration.
		 * The setting `files.watcherExclude` helps to reduce the overhead of file events from folders
		 * that are known to produce many file changes at once (such as `.git` folders). As such,
		 * it is highly recommended to watch with simple patterns that do not require recursive watchers
		 * where the exclude settings are ignored and you have full control over the events.
		 *
		 * *Note* that symbolic links are not automatically followed for file watching unless the path to
		 * watch itself is a symbolic link.
		 *
		 * *Note* that the file paths that are reported for having changed may have a different path casing
		 * compared to the actual casing on disk on case-insensitive platforms (typically macOS and Windows
		 * but not Linux). We allow a user to open a workspace folder with any desired path casing and try
		 * to preserve that. This means:
		 * * if the path is within any of the workspace folders, the path will match the casing of the
		 *   workspace folder up to that portion of the path and match the casing on disk for children
		 * * if the path is outside of any of the workspace folders, the casing will match the case of the
		 *   path that was provided for watching
		 * In the same way, symbolic links are preserved, i.e. the file event will report the path of the
		 * symbolic link as it was provided for watching and not the target.
		 *
		 * ### Examples
		 *
		 * The basic anatomy of a file watcher is as follows:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * const watcher = vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(<folder>, <pattern>));
		 *
		 * watcher.onDidChange(uri => { ... }); // listen to files being changed
		 * watcher.onDidCreate(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders being created
		 * watcher.onDidDelete(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders getting deleted
		 *
		 * watcher.dispose(); // dispose after usage
		 * ```
		 *
		 * #### Workspace file watching
		 *
		 * If you only care about file events in a specific workspace folder:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0], '**​/*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * If you want to monitor file events across all opened workspace folders:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**​/*.js');
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *Note:* the array of workspace folders can be empty if no workspace is opened (empty window).
		 *
		 * #### Out of workspace file watching
		 *
		 * To watch a folder for changes to *.js files outside the workspace (non recursively), pass in a `Uri` to such
		 * a folder:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * And use a complex glob pattern to watch recursively:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '**​/*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Here is an example for watching the active editor for file changes:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri, '*'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @param globPattern A {@link GlobPattern glob pattern} that controls which file events the watcher should report.
		 * @param ignoreCreateEvents Ignore when files have been created.
		 * @param ignoreChangeEvents Ignore when files have been changed.
		 * @param ignoreDeleteEvents Ignore when files have been deleted.
		 * @returns A new file system watcher instance. Must be disposed when no longer needed.

	 * Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),

	 *
	 * Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
	 * like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
	 * programming languages.
	 *
	 * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	 * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
	 * that can be called with a {@link TextDocument} and a {@link Position} returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
	 * mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
	 * 	provideHover(document, position, token) {
	 * 		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
	 * 	}
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Registration is done using a {@link DocumentSelector document selector} which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
	 * a more complex {@link DocumentFilter filter} like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
	 * a selector will result in a {@link languages.match score} that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	 * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like {@link languages.registerHoverProvider hover},
	 * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like {@link languages.registerCompletionItemProvider IntelliSense} the
	 * score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

		 *    1. When the `DocumentFilter` is empty (`{}`) the result is `0`
		 *    2. When `scheme`, `language`, `pattern`, or `notebook` are defined but one doesn't match, the result is `0`
		 *    3. Matching against `*` gives a score of `5`, matching via equality or via a glob-pattern gives a score of `10`

		/**
		 * Tokens in a file are represented as an array of integers. The position of each token is expressed relative to
		 * the token before it, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * In short, each token takes 5 integers to represent, so a specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:
		 *  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
		 *  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
		 *  - at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
		 *  - at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
		 *  - at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How to encode tokens
		 *
		 * Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a uint32 array:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",  tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",     tokenModifiers: [] }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 1. First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types.
		 * For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
		 * ```
		 *    tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
		 *    tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 2. The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked
		 * up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
		 * so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because
		 * bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 3. The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token
		 * is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar`
		 * of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the
		 * `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
		 * ```
		 *    { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 4. Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @see {@link SemanticTokensBuilder} for a helper to encode tokens as integers.
		 * *NOTE*: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until the editor decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.
		 */
		provideDocumentSemanticTokens(document: TextDocument, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>;

		/**
		 * Instead of always returning all the tokens in a file, it is possible for a `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider` to implement
		 * this method (`provideDocumentSemanticTokensEdits`) and then return incremental updates to the previously provided semantic tokens.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How tokens change when the document changes
		 *
		 * Suppose that `provideDocumentSemanticTokens` has previously returned the following semantic tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Also suppose that after some edits, the new semantic tokens in a file are:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 * It is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // old tokens
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // new tokens
		 *
		 *    edit: { start:  0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] } // replace integer at offset 0 with 3
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot compute `SemanticTokensEdits`, it can "give up" and return all the tokens in the document again.
		 * *NOTE*: All edits in `SemanticTokensEdits` contain indices in the old integers array, so they all refer to the previous result state.

		 * #### `http:` or `https:` scheme
		 *
		 * Resolves an *external* uri, such as a `http:` or `https:` link, from where the extension is running to a
		 * uri to the same resource on the client machine.
		 *
		 * This is a no-op if the extension is running on the client machine.
		 *
		 * If the extension is running remotely, this function automatically establishes a port forwarding tunnel
		 * from the local machine to `target` on the remote and returns a local uri to the tunnel. The lifetime of
		 * the port forwarding tunnel is managed by the editor and the tunnel can be closed by the user.
		 *
		 * *Note* that uris passed through `openExternal` are automatically resolved and you should not call `asExternalUri` on them.
		 *
		 * #### `vscode.env.uriScheme`
		 *
		 * Creates a uri that - if opened in a browser (e.g. via `openExternal`) - will result in a registered {@link UriHandler}
		 * to trigger.
		 *
		 * Extensions should not make any assumptions about the resulting uri and should not alter it in any way.
		 * Rather, extensions can e.g. use this uri in an authentication flow, by adding the uri as callback query
		 * argument to the server to authenticate to.
		 *
		 * *Note* that if the server decides to add additional query parameters to the uri (e.g. a token or secret), it
		 * will appear in the uri that is passed to the {@link UriHandler}.
		 *
		 * **Example** of an authentication flow:
		 * ```typescript
		 * vscode.window.registerUriHandler({
		 *   handleUri(uri: vscode.Uri): vscode.ProviderResult<void> {
		 *     if (uri.path === '/did-authenticate') {
		 *       console.log(uri.toString());
		 *     }
		 *   }
		 * });
		 *
		 * const callableUri = await vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(vscode.env.uriScheme + '://my.extension/did-authenticate'));
		 * await vscode.env.openExternal(callableUri);
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *Note* that extensions should not cache the result of `asExternalUri` as the resolved uri may become invalid due to
		 * a system or user action — for example, in remote cases, a user may close a port forwarding tunnel that was opened by
		 * `asExternalUri`.
		 *
		 * #### Any other scheme
		 *
		 * Any other scheme will be handled as if the provided URI is a workspace URI. In that case, the method will return
		 * a URI which, when handled, will make the editor open the workspace.
		 *
		 * @returns A uri that can be used on the client machine.

		/**
		 * Creates a file system watcher that is notified on file events (create, change, delete)
		 * depending on the parameters provided.
		 *
		 * By default, all opened {@link workspace.workspaceFolders workspace folders} will be watched
		 * for file changes recursively.
		 *
		 * Additional paths can be added for file watching by providing a {@link RelativePattern} with
		 * a `base` path to watch. If the path is a folder and the `pattern` is complex (e.g. contains
		 * `**` or path segments), it will be watched recursively and otherwise will be watched
		 * non-recursively (i.e. only changes to the first level of the path will be reported).
		 *
		 * *Note* that paths that do not exist in the file system will be monitored with a delay until
		 * created and then watched depending on the parameters provided. If a watched path is deleted,
		 * the watcher will suspend and not report any events until the path is created again.
		 *
		 * If possible, keep the use of recursive watchers to a minimum because recursive file watching
		 * is quite resource intense.
		 *
		 * Providing a `string` as `globPattern` acts as convenience method for watching file events in
		 * all opened workspace folders. It cannot be used to add more folders for file watching, nor will
		 * it report any file events from folders that are not part of the opened workspace folders.
		 *
		 * Optionally, flags to ignore certain kinds of events can be provided.
		 *
		 * To stop listening to events the watcher must be disposed.
		 *
		 * *Note* that file events from recursive file watchers may be excluded based on user configuration.
		 * The setting `files.watcherExclude` helps to reduce the overhead of file events from folders
		 * that are known to produce many file changes at once (such as `.git` folders). As such,
		 * it is highly recommended to watch with simple patterns that do not require recursive watchers
		 * where the exclude settings are ignored and you have full control over the events.
		 *
		 * *Note* that symbolic links are not automatically followed for file watching unless the path to
		 * watch itself is a symbolic link.
		 *
		 * *Note* that the file paths that are reported for having changed may have a different path casing
		 * compared to the actual casing on disk on case-insensitive platforms (typically macOS and Windows
		 * but not Linux). We allow a user to open a workspace folder with any desired path casing and try
		 * to preserve that. This means:
		 * * if the path is within any of the workspace folders, the path will match the casing of the
		 *   workspace folder up to that portion of the path and match the casing on disk for children
		 * * if the path is outside of any of the workspace folders, the casing will match the case of the
		 *   path that was provided for watching
		 * In the same way, symbolic links are preserved, i.e. the file event will report the path of the
		 * symbolic link as it was provided for watching and not the target.
		 *
		 * ### Examples
		 *
		 * The basic anatomy of a file watcher is as follows:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * const watcher = vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(<folder>, <pattern>));
		 *
		 * watcher.onDidChange(uri => { ... }); // listen to files being changed
		 * watcher.onDidCreate(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders being created
		 * watcher.onDidDelete(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders getting deleted
		 *
		 * watcher.dispose(); // dispose after usage
		 * ```
		 *
		 * #### Workspace file watching
		 *
		 * If you only care about file events in a specific workspace folder:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0], '**​/*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * If you want to monitor file events across all opened workspace folders:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**​/*.js');
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *Note:* the array of workspace folders can be empty if no workspace is opened (empty window).
		 *
		 * #### Out of workspace file watching
		 *
		 * To watch a folder for changes to *.js files outside the workspace (non recursively), pass in a `Uri` to such
		 * a folder:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * And use a complex glob pattern to watch recursively:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '**​/*.js'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Here is an example for watching the active editor for file changes:
		 *
		 * ```ts
		 * vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri, '*'));
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @param globPattern A {@link GlobPattern glob pattern} that controls which file events the watcher should report.
		 * @param ignoreCreateEvents Ignore when files have been created.
		 * @param ignoreChangeEvents Ignore when files have been changed.
		 * @param ignoreDeleteEvents Ignore when files have been deleted.
		 * @returns A new file system watcher instance. Must be disposed when no longer needed.

	 * Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),
	 * like IntelliSense, code actions, diagnostics etc.
	 *
	 * Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
	 * like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
	 * programming languages.
	 *
	 * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	 * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
	 * that can be called with a {@link TextDocument} and a {@link Position} returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
	 * mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
	 * 	provideHover(document, position, token) {
	 * 		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
	 * 	}
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Registration is done using a {@link DocumentSelector document selector} which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
	 * a more complex {@link DocumentFilter filter} like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
	 * a selector will result in a {@link languages.match score} that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	 * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like {@link languages.registerHoverProvider hover},
	 * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like {@link languages.registerCompletionItemProvider IntelliSense} the
	 * score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

		 *
		 * A match is computed according to these rules:
		 * 1. When {@linkcode DocumentSelector} is an array, compute the match for each contained `DocumentFilter` or language identifier and take the maximum value.
		 * 2. A string will be desugared to become the `language`-part of a {@linkcode DocumentFilter}, so `"fooLang"` is like `{ language: "fooLang" }`.
		 * 3. A {@linkcode DocumentFilter} will be matched against the document by comparing its parts with the document. The following rules apply:
		 *    1. When the `DocumentFilter` is empty (`{}`) the result is `0`
		 *    2. When `scheme`, `language`, `pattern`, or `notebook` are defined but one doesn't match, the result is `0`
		 *    3. Matching against `*` gives a score of `5`, matching via equality or via a glob-pattern gives a score of `10`
		 *    4. The result is the maximum value of each match

// Import required libraries
        // Add your settings hereThis error message "应为 JSON 对象、数组或文本" is in Chinese and translates to "Should be a JSON object, array or text" in English.

 error occurs because the input appears to be minified JavaScript code rather than valid JSON data. The code snippet you shared looks like part of a webpack bundle or other bundled JavaScript file.

To fix this error:

1. If you're trying to parse this as JSON, make sure you're working with proper JSON data format like:

```json
{https://github.com/continuedev/continue.git/*  */

  "key": "value",
  "numbers": [1, 2, 3],
  "object": {To address the issue, we need to ensure that the content you're dealing with is in a valid JSON format if that's what you're trying to parse or process. Here's a step-by-step approach to resolve the problem:

  1. **Identify the Source**: Determine whether this content is coming from an API, a file, or another source. Ensure that you expect JSON data at this point in your application.
  
  2. **Check the Content Type**: If this is from an API, ensure the response content type is set to `application/json`. This can help avoid confusion between JSON and other data formats.
  
  3. **Validate JSON Structure**: JSON must be either an object (`{}`), an array (`[{
    "employees": {
        "employee": [
            {
                "id": "1",
                "firstName": "Tom",
                "lastName": "Cruise",
                "photo": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/735509975649378305/B81JwLT7.jpg"
            },
            {
                "id": "2",
                "firstName": "Maria",
                "lastName": "Sharapova",
                "photo": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/3424509849/bfa1b9121afc39d1dcdb53cfc423bf12.jpeg"
            },
            {
                "id": "3",
                "firstName": "James",
                "lastName": "Bond",
                "photo": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/664886718559076352/M00cOLrh.jpg"
            }
        ]
    }
}]`), or a valid JSON string/number/boolean. The content you provided is JavaScript, not JSON. If you need JSON, it should look like:
     ```json
     {
       "key": "value",
       "array": [1, 2, 3],
       "nested": {
         "innerKey": "innerValue"
       }
     }
     ```
  
  4. **Correct the Source**: If you're mistakenly trying to parse JavaScript as JSON, adjust your code to handle it correctly as JavaScript, or change the source to provide valid JSON if that's what's needed.
  
  5. **Debugging**: Use tools like JSON validators or debuggers to ensure the data is in the correct format before attempting to parse it.
  
  6. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling in your code to catch and manage parsing errors gracefully, providing user-friendly messages or fallbacks.
  
  If you provide more context on how this data is being used or the specific environment (e.g., a web application, server-side script, etc.), I can offer more tailored advice.


    "nested": "data"
    tabAutocompleteModel

  }
}
```

2. If you're trying to work with this JavaScript code:
   - Make sure you're not trying to parse it as JSON
   - Use it directly as JavaScript code
   - If this is part of a build process, ensure your bundler/webpack configuration is correct

3. If you're receiving this from an API:
   - Check that the API endpoint is returning the correct content type
   - Verify the API is returning properly formatted JSON data
   - Make sure you're not getting a JavaScript file instead of JSON data

Without more context about where and how you're using this code, I can't provide more specific guidance. Could you share more details about what you're trying to accomplish? That would help in providing a more tailored solution.
